\chapter{Hardware}\label{ch:hardware}
This chapter will give an overview of the hardware used for implementing a Kalman filter for the purpose of tracking a high altitude balloon.
It will also include answers to the SSEQ (Standard Sensor Exercise Questions) for the sensors used in the project.

\section{MCU}\label{sec:mcu}
The microcontroller used in this project is the STM32F446RE. The STM32F446RE is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller with a maximum CPU frequency of 180 MHz. The microcontroller has 512 KB of flash memory and 128 KB of RAM. The microcontroller has a variety of peripherals, including SPI, I2C, UART, and CAN. 
This particular microcontroller was chosen because it is the microcontroller used
