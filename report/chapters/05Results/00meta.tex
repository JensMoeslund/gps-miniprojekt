\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
This chapter will give an overview of the results of the tests performed on the system.

\section{Stationary test}\label{sec:stationary-test}
The stationary test is a test to determine the measurement noise of the sensors.
The test is done by placing the sensors in a stationary position, and measuring the noise of the sensors.
A plot of measured values can be seen in \autoref{fig:stationary-test}.

From this test the measurement noise of the sensors is found to be:

\section{Kalman filter test}\label{sec:kalman-filter-test}
In this test the Kalman filter is tested.
Due to time constraints, the test is done on the stationary data from the stationary test.
It can however be seen that the Kalman filter is able to filter out the noise from the sensors, and combine the multiple sensors to a more accurate estimate.
A plot of the estimated altitude can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:kalman-filter-test}.
